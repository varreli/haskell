Jun 05 15:57:56 <xenon->	 I was reading about fasting benefits for weight loss as well, but I haven't tried it
Jun 05 15:58:25 <xenon->	how long did you fast? [and sure, go ahead and explain it further if you have the time]
Jun 05 15:59:11 <crestfallen>	I'd be happy to. one moment please
Jun 05 16:02:47 <xenon->	sure
Jun 05 16:19:36 <crestfallen>	it requires a radical new understanding. whether the complaint is overweight, poor eyesight or skin problems, cancer or any dis-ease: fasting is the only true healing from nature. It's called "nature's operating table." Animals fast in the wild when ill. Humans forgot this, but it is part of our dna code to fast. dry fasting differs fundamentally from water fasting but is also included in our dna. in 
Jun 05 16:19:36 <crestfallen>	water fasting toxins in a cell are passed to the bloodstream or lymph. In dry fasting the cell shuts down and burns, furnace-like, anything foreign, including scar tissue. this is a general explanation of the distinction. so the paradigm of water fasting and the dry-fasting paradigm are distinct. In the case of weight gain, the imbalances in the endocrine system caused by wrong diet, are the main 
Jun 05 16:19:36 <crestfallen>	culprit. Excessive calories may contribute to this imbalance, but cannot be treated as the only analysis. studying caloric intake is actually a delusional way of looking at it. when the body reaches balance again the person will lose weight naturally. It requires a whole new understanding. I'd be happy to continue, and can at the very least send you a google drive book to read that will get you 
Jun 05 16:19:36 <crestfallen>	started. If you'd like, we can continue anytime via email as well.   johnwerner@berkeley.edu    but I have time now and enjoy encouraging people. I have absolutely nothing to sell; I'm a sort of monk and healer, have been for a long time, and dry fasting is just the next logical step.
Jun 05 16:24:09 <crestfallen>	intermittent fasting has made it into mainstream athletics. it is actually used to help athletes *gain* weight, because after fasting the digestive tract is made very efficient, and better weight gain is possible. even athletes who have trouble gaining weight. it makes sense if you think about how the villi in the intestine absorbs food. when obstructed, there is less surface area in the villi to 
Jun 05 16:24:09 <crestfallen>	absorb food.
Jun 05 16:24:18 <xenon->	thanks, I'd like to know more. I'll send you an email tonight
Jun 05 16:24:33 <xenon->	just one quick question, how long do you fast at a time?
Jun 05 16:29:04 <crestfallen>	some people use OMAD (one meal a day) so say you eat once meal in the afternoon, drink something within a narrow time window (say 1-2 hours) then do it again. that's a lifestyle of fasting very popular now. generally, to reach a ketosis state, 24 hour minimum is required. for people more health challenged, it takes longer to reach ketosis. I fast (to answer your question!) 24, 36, 60 hrs, 5 days, 10 
Jun 05 16:29:04 <crestfallen>	days on strict fruit diet, many types of fast. to clarify, dry fasting is what is new to me. I dry fast 15, 20,27, 40 hour dry fasts. not recommended for someone new.
Jun 05 16:30:32 <crestfallen>	I'll explain more. looking forward to your email. you may have noticed, I'm located in SF Bay Area CA USA
Jun 05 16:36:35 <xenon->	appreciate the time you took to write all this. I'll send you an email. I can lose weight by other means too, I've done it before, but gained some back recently. but I'm very intrigued about possibility of improving mental focus and memory through diet change 
Jun 05 16:40:25 <crestfallen>	human life is beautiful. our body/mind is so powerful; it's way beyond weight loss, hopefully you'll find that to be just an entry point. talk later..
Jun 05 16:41:35 <xenon->	very true.. see you
