For product types:

if we have 

  |Bool| = 2, |Ordering| = 3, 
  |(Bool, Ordering)| = 6 (6 possible inhabitants)
  
  |(a,b)| = |a|*|b|, ie the product of inhabitants.

  It's a type that is a product of other types. A 
  product type. And since it's not being given 
  a name, it is an anonymous product type.

--

For sum types: Either a b = Left a | Right b

if we have 

   Either Bool Ordering 
   
we have 5 inhabitants: Left False, Left True, Right LT, Right EQ and Right GT.
