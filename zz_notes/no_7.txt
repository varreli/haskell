b) (λx.λy.λz.xz(yz))(λx.z)(λx.a)

c) (λy.λz1.(λx.z)z1(yz1))(λx.a)

d) (λz1.(λx.z)(z1)((λx.a)z1))

e) (λz1.z((λx.a)(z1)))

f) (λz1.za)


note: λ__ .a -> a

note: We can define recursive functions, even though functions in
λ calculus are not given names and thus cannot refer explicityly
to themselves.

notation: (λx.x)y = [y/x]x = y  -- In this transformation the notation
[y/x] is used to indicate that all occurances of x are substituted
by y in the expression to the right.
