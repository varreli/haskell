Typeclasses are dispatched by type, and are
defined by the set of operations and values
all instances will provide. Typeclass instances
are unique pairings of the typeclass and a
type. Sometimes when an instance is defined, it
is a derived instance that is generated based on
how the type is defined. They define the ways to 
implement the typeclass methods for that type.
