You could write an application, and focus on nothing 
but building the following habit: before you write a 
function, stub it out as undefined and make sure the 
type signature compiles (we'll discuss this technique 
in more detail in part 4! It doesn't matter if you do 
anything else right! After you've gotten into that 
habit, you could also take another step. You could make 
sure you always write the functionâ€™s invocation (where 
your other code calls the function) before you implement 
it.
