-- note on accumulators : 'Updating' an acc sounds imperative,
-- but is ok as a mental model if we know we're updating where 
-- variables point and not mutating what they point to.

-- Imagine variables as labels pointing to the various actual 
-- values in memory. Mutating would be like keeping acc pointing 
-- to the same memory, but modifying the value there. We don't 
-- do that; we merely point acc to another location.
