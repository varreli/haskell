 state.hs:6:49: error:
     • No instance for (Show (State -> (a, State)))
             arising from the first field of ‘S’ (type ‘State -> (a, State)’)
                     (maybe you haven't applied a function to enough arguments?)
                           Possible fix:
                                   use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
                                             so you can specify the instance context yourself
