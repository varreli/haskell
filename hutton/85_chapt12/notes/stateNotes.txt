-- Motivation for State:

-- A pure functional language cannot update values 
-- in place because it violates referential transparency. 
-- A common idiom to simulate such stateful computations 
-- is to "thread" a state parameter through a sequence of 
-- functions.

-- The State monad hides the threading of the state parameter 
-- inside the binding operation, simultaneously making the 
-- code easier to write, easier to read and easier to modify.
