The state being passed from `stf` to `stx` is s'

giving state to stf results in a tuple of a new state 
called s' and a function called f. this is what the 
line "let (f,s') = app stf s" is doing.

that new state s' is then used to give state to stx, 
giving another new state called s'' and a value 
called x. the last thing we do is apply our function 
f to our value x because that's what our type signature 
requires, and bundle that with the last state.
