Impurity doesn't permeate entire programs. the vast majority 
of functions do not involve interaction, which instead is 
handled by a relatively small number of interactive functions 
at the outermost level.

Sequencing:

do v1 <- a1                        -- actions yield values by the    
   v2 <- a2                        -- use of generators
   ...
   vn <- an
   return (f v1 v2 ... vn)

-- if the result value vi is not required, abbreviate the notation
-- to ai, which means the same as if using the wildcard:

   _ <- ai

-- Read 3 characters, discard 2nd and return 1st and 3rd as a pair:

act :: IO (Char,Char)
act = do x <- getChar getChar
y <- getChar
return (x,y)

Prelude> act rfg
(r,g)
