Suppose there are finitely many primes. Then we can 
enumerate them as a set

{p1, p2, p3 ... pn}.

The number 

P = { p1 * p2 ... pn } + 1 

is either prime or composite. If it is prime, then 
we have found a prime that is not among the finite set

{ p1, p2 ... pn} 

of primes we assumed to comprise the collection of 
all primes. 

If it is composite, then it is divisible by a prime. 
But it cannot be divisible by any of { p1, p2 ... pn } 
for upon dividing P by any of these primes, it leaves 
a remainder of 1. Therefore, P is divisible by a prime 
that again is not in the presumed set of all primes. 

In either case, a contradiction is obtained in which 
the assumption that there are finitely many primes is 
violated.

***  HOWEVER

Euclidâ€™s proof differs from the modern conception, which is
that it used contradiction.

He said this :

Take any finite set of primes. Any. It could be {2, 7, 31} 
or {5, 11, 13}.

Multiply them and add 1. Then show (and this part *was* done 
by contradiction) that the prime factors of the resulting 
number are not in the finite set you started with. 

So 5 * 11 * 13 (+1) = 716. 716 has prime factors: 2, 179 or
(2 * 2 * 179).

Thus every finite set of primes can be extended to a larger 
finite set of primes.
