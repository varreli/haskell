polymorphism

The first type is parametric and is more general : 

a function is parametrically polymorphic if it behaves uniformly for all types, in at least one of its type parameters.

The function length is parametric polymorphism -- it returns the length of a list, no matter what type is stored in its list:

length :: [a] -> Int

The polymorphism is indicated by a lower case type variable.
