A combinator is a term. A closure is a (term, context) pair. 

Suppose we are in a context where x = 2

Then: 

\y -> y + 2   and   \y -> y + x 

*denote* the same function in this context.


term1 = \y -> y + 2
term2 = \y -> y + x

Note that term1 and term2 are *terms*, not functions. In principle, 
the same term may denote different things in different contexts.


This is a closure:

(  \y -> y + x   ,   x = 2  )

       term        context
