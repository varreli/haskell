Thank you for considering me as the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve Steward. 

Currently I serve at UC Berkeley Earth and Planetary Science. I am an unmarried male without children, in excellent physical condition. My significant other travels extensively and is primarily located in Berkeley, Los Angeles and Sicily. While reading my resume, you may agree that The Reserve Steward position would be an excellent fit, and I'd like to elaborate here.

I'm an extremely adaptive person. I've travelled and lived all over the world. My work experience domestically and abroad has taught me to endure and perservere and thrive. The job description makes my mind race through all of the work I've done in my life. For example, I've run chainsaws for at least 500 hours, and state-of-the-art brush-clearing saws upwards to 700 hours. When I was much younger my grandfather taught me to operate a backhoe. I can operate bobcat front loaders and probably any extension on a bobcat. After years of brush-clearing and with tree crews I became fully immune to poison oak. 

Incidently, I am writing directly, because and in spite of the fact I have a BA in English from UC Berkeley.

Presently I preside over a wood and metal shop at Earth and Planetary Science. I can operate the table saw, band saw, drill press, and with some guidance a mill. Also I have competence with numerous power and hand tools, including one of my favorite tools ever: a splitting maul. 

I'm not a journeyman but have confidence around all sorts of tools and machinery. You see, I grew up in my father's car dealership and these things are second nature.

I can operate any power boat up to say 35 feet, and longer with some practice. I grew up around marinas and sailing clubs. I can sail hobie cats and 420 racing class boats including crewing on the trapeze. I can operate ski boats and I'm an accomplished water skier.

Presently my primary job title is Field Coordinator and Safety Liaison. Please read the resume entry regarding this. Working on UC Berkeley Staff, I have maintained my training on all of the sensitive issues that are crucial to UC system culture. This includes sexual harassment and computer security. Also through the UC Police I attended Active Shooter training.
