Commitment based on guidance from Martin Gelbaum,
my old Buddhist Friend in the SGI. Once committed
to GitHub, this goes for full Fall 2017 Semester.

1) Chant as much as possible, with SGI and
the Independent Practice. Do Gongyo more.
Chant often for Cameron and Mom, Family.
* Namu Myoho Renge Kyo *

2) Study Haskell at every possible opportunity.

3) Find willing Mentors on the UC Campus for
Haskell and Math. 5 Mentors:
- Prof. Kenneth Ribet
- Prof. Daniel Garcia (?)

4) No YouTube or Xhamster for entire semester.
Only full feature movies and documentaries.

5) No contentiousness online with SGI or IRC
altercations. Compassionate behavior online.

6) Excellent Health and overcoming Hip Injury.
Work on grape cure and alternative methods.
