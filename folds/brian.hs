-- flip is required because the types need to 
-- agree with (:) . First, foldl extracts 10 :

-- foldl (flip (:)) [1,2,3] [10,11]
-- is the same as:
(:) 10 [1,2,3]
(:) 11 [10,1,2,3]

[11,10,1,2,3]

-- Unification of foldl and (flip (:))   

-- (:) has this pattern 
a -> [a] -> [a] 
-- featured in our exercise: 1:[2] -> [1,2]

-- the correct pattern for foldl is (flip (:)) ,
-- requiring the parameters of (:) to be flipped 
-- (compare with line 14) :

[a] -> a -> [a]

-- we then substitute ([a] -> a -> [a]) for the
-- (b -> a -> b) here:

foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b

-- can you see how they are the same? 
-- ([a] -> a -> [a])
-- ( b  -> a ->  b )

-- (flip (:)) is satisfied, and the remainder of the 
-- signature is the last 3 elements of foldl, 
-- b -> [a] -> b , altered by ghci to indicate the 
-- 'foldable' t :

foldl (flip (:)) :: Foldable t => [a] -> t a -> [a]

-- so now substitute in our relations of those to t: 
-- (b ~ [t], a ~ t):  

foldl :: ([t] -> t -> [t]) -> [t] -> [t] -> [t]
foldl (flip (:)) :: [t] -> [t] -> [t]

-- b unifies with [t], a unifies with t 

-- (flip (:)) is handed the current base (b) and a list 
-- element (a) and produces a new base (b). You provide
-- an initial base or 'seed' (misnamed accumulator), 
-- and a list (Foldable).  


-- examples:

位 > foldl (/) 64 [1,2,4] 
位 > scanl (/) 64 [1,4,2] 

位 > foldl (-) 30 [1,2] 
位 > scanl (/) 30 [1,2] 

-- the first parameter (64) is the base, or seed.
-- It isn't updated, its just replaced with a new value.
-- Updating is mutation but this parameter is immutable.


-- Prelude > foldl (\x y -> 2*x + y) 4 [1,2,3]
