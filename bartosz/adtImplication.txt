Tri = Zelda | Link | Ganon
Bool = False | True

When we are counting inhabitants of a -> b  ==  b ^ a

Tri -> Bool  ==  Bool ^ Tri (2 ^ 3 = 8)
Bool -> Tri  ==  Tri ^ Bool (3 ^ 2 = 9)

A function X -> Bool is equivalent to a subset 
of X: if the value on an argument is true, it 
belongs to our subset, and if it's false, it doesn't.

Any subset of X yields a function X -> Bool this way, 
and any function X -> Bool yields a subset
