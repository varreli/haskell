A procedure can itself be given a type: say the type of a transformer from
a-type objects to b-type objects. The type of such a procedure
can be declared in Haskell as a -> b.


This takes two strings and returns
String -> (String -> String)

This type can be written as String -> String -> String, because of the Haskell
convention that -> associates to the right.
