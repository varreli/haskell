f $ a = f a
(2^) $ 2 + 2 $ (*30)

-- Given the right-associativity (infixr) of $
-- we must begin at the right-most position.

2 + 2 $ (*30)
-- reduce ($)
(2 + 2) (*30)

-- then we must evaluate (2 + 2) before we can apply it

4 (*30)

-- We can't apply 4 as if it was a function to the argument (*30):
