-- A bound variable is a variable that was 
-- previously free, but has been bound to a 
-- specific value or set of values.
-- For example, the variable x becomes a bound 
-- variable when we write:

-- For all x, (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1

-- or

-- There exists x such that x^2 = 2

-- In either of these propositions, it does not 
-- matter logically whether we use x or some 
-- other letter.
-- However, it could be confusing to use the 
-- same letter again elsewhere in some compound 
-- proposition.
-- That is, free variables become bound, and 
-- then in a sense retire from being available as 
-- stand-in values for other values in the 
-- creation of formulae.


-- A free variable is one not local to the 
-- expression. E.g. in:

-- Î»x.xy

-- y is free.
