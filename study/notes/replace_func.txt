Once we apply the function, we can replace the fully applied 
function with its body and bound arguments.

-- E*valu*ation means an expression is reducible to a value.

-- triple x = x * 3
-- triple 2
-- [triple x = x * 3; x:= 2] -- x is bound to 2

-- triple 2 is in its canonical or normal form when it returns
-- 6 , since it is irreducible.
