Monads donâ€™t manipulate values themselves â€” what does that are 
functions you plumb together using the monad.

Monads are a general model of computation that lets you 
choose the environmental features that you want for your 
computations.

A monad is a type for which the >>= operation and unit (return) 
is defined.
