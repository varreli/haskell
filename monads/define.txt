       -- ma >>= \v -> mb combines a monadic value 
       -- ma containing values of type a and a function 
       -- which operates on a value v of type a, 
       -- returning the monadic value mb.

       -- used when the function does not need the value 
       -- produced by the first monadic operator:

       m >> k           = m >>= \_ -> k



       return :: a -> m a

       -- the return operation injects a value into the 
       -- monad (container).

-- It is possible to write imperative-style code in Haskell as well. 
-- Sometimes we really do want to say something like "do A, then do B, 
-- then do C". This adds a new dimension to the simple world of function 
-- application: we need a notion of 'happens before'. Haskell has 
-- embraced the Monad concept to describe computations that have an 
-- order of evaluation. This turns out to be very handy because it can 
-- encapsulate effects such as changing state.
