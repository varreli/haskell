-- Functor => is a superclass of: 
-- Applicative => is a superclass of:
-- Monad

-- Foldable => is a superclass of:
-- Traversable.
-- 
-- Removing a superclass destroys the relationship between the
-- classes and their corresponding laws and operations. 
-- 
-- Eq => is a superclass of:
-- Ord.

-- There are laws dictating how the corresponding classes should 
-- work.
-- 
-- It would seem remarkably backwards to finally unify all the 
-- work on Applicative and Monad and simultaneously cleave apart 
-- all the work on Foldable and Traversable creating a variant 
-- on the ap vs. (<*>), fmap vs. liftM problem but now 
-- spanning dozens of combinators.
