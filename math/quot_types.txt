the type of integers mod n is represented by the quotient 
type ℤ/nℤ. The idea is that the values of ℤ/nℤ are integers 
except that we agree that any two integers a and b are 
treated as equal if a − b = kn for some integer k.



quotient types are about the possible redundancy in representation, 
that is why they are used to describe Int mod n . The 3 is redundant
in the arithmetic progressions of Int mod 3 :

For ℤ/3ℤ :

... −6 = −3 = 0 = 3 = 6 = ...

and 

... = −5 = −2 = 1 = 4 = 7 = ...


If an implementation wanted to, it should be able to 
(silently) replace one representation , say 3 , with another equivalent 
representation , say 6 , at run-time.
