proving that 2 sides of a primitive pythagorean triangle 
cannot both be odd :


a = 2x + 1
b = 2y + 1
c = 2z

(If both a and b are odd, c must be even)


Substitute into a^2 + b^2 = c^2  :

(2x + 1)^2 + (2y + 1)^2 = (2z)^2

4x^2 + 4x + 4y^2 + 4y + 2 = 4z^2

Now divide by 2 : 

2x^2 + 2x + 2y^2 + 2y + 1 = 2z^2

This last equation says that an odd number is equal to an 
even number which is a contradiction, so a and b
cannot both be odd.
