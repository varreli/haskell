Find all solutions to the equation a^2  +  b^2 = c^2

with        { a odd, 
              b even
              a, b and c having no common factors }

this is a primitive or reduced pythagorean triple.

With Primitive triples we can factor :

a^ = c^2 - b^2 = (c - b) (c + b)

(b + c) and (b - c) are always squares so we can write:

c + b = s^2   and c - b = t^2

do you agree that if W = X and Y = Z, then W+Y = X+Z ?

so if c+b = s^2 and c-b = t^2, then c+b + c-b = s^2 + t^2

2c = s^2 + t^2

c= (s^2+t^2)/2

either add or substract the equations. in other words, 
add the left sides together and the right sides together, 
or subtract the left sides from each other and the right 
sides from each other


you can always do that because if the sides are equal before, they remain equal after

an alternative method is to find e.g. "c = s^2 - b" and insert that in the second equation

turning it into s^2 - b - b = t^2, and so on
