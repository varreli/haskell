Congruence: Def a,b are congruent 
mod m <=> m | (a-b)

Def [a] x [b] = [ a x b ]

[0] in Z/mZ behaves like 0 elem Z [ 0 ] + [ a ] = [ a ]
[ 1 ] x [ a ] = [ a ]

[ 1 ] + .... + [ 1 ] = [ m ] = [ 0 ]

r,s elem Z s.t.
r x s = m
[ r ] [ s ] = [ m ] = [ 0 ]

Prop: For every m elem N, a elem Z
the congruence ax congruent 1 mod m
has a solution iff a, m are coprime ( gcd (0,m) = 1 )

Pf gcd (a,m) = 1 <=> such that u,v elem Q
                     au + mv = 1

Euclids Lemma: a,b elem Z p a prime If p|ab then p|a or p|b 


(learn proof thereof ^)

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
If n elem Z and n > 1 , n can be factored uniquely into a product of primes

Existence
if C is not prime, C = (some) ab

Def of Groups
First let G be a set
a binary operation is a map of sets
* GxG -> G 
write a*b for *(a,b) for a,b elem G


a group is a st G together with a binary operation *, such that
1. (Associativey): (a * b) * c = a* (b*c)
2. (Identity) there exists e elem G s.t. a*e = e*a = a for all a elem G
3. (Inverse): 

The trivial group
{ identity } 

Why is the empty set not a group? { }
Because identity is not satisfied.

Monoid : no need for the inverse.
(Z *) is a monoid, but not a group.

Def a group (G, * ) is call Abelian (commutative) if it also 
satisfies a*b = b*a forAll a,b elem G.
