The class Integral provides whole-number 
division and remainder operations. The 
standard instances of Integral are Integer 
(unbounded or mathematical integers, also 
known as "bignums") and Int (bounded, 
machine integers, with a range equivalent 
to at least 29-bit signed binary). This 
would allow us to use Int, Int32, and Int64. 

The Integral typeclass only has functionality 
for divMod and quotRem .. and toInteger.
