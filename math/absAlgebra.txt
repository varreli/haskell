For most people, an off-the-shelf tool is sufficient to get 
adequate performance. So here the crucial thing is knowing 
about the semantics of such libraries so you can glue them 
together in an efficient way. 

This is where tools like logic and abstract algebra become 
crucial: the focus is on constructing composable interfaces 
which are easy to reason about, rather than focusing so much 
on absolute performance of a particular implementation.
