Propositions as Types

The relation between Proofs and Propostions

   Proofs

Propositions    --   =


 Programs

  Types


Proofs justify propositions
Programs justify types

Prop = Bool         -- doesn't work in CS

Prop = Type         -- The evidence of a proposition
                    -- is the Type of its proof

P ^ (Q v R) -> P ^ Q  v  P ^ R

To prove this is a tautology, with Prop as Bool
we would draw a truth table.

With Prop as Types,
