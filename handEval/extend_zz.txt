find n , such that (( 13 * n ) mod 17 = 1 )

multiples of both inputs are calculated to combine with 
eachother and give us 1

4 is the solution, not (-3, 4)

since if you take the gcd linear combination "1 = (-3)路17 + 4路13" 
and apply "mod 17" to it, you'll get "1 = (4路13) mod 17"

(that's because of the homomorphic properties of the "mod" operator)

-3 is the factor for the modulus 17, so it's not relevant

Whenever you pick a pair of coprime numbers (m,x), and you want 
to find a number y, such that ((x路y) mod m = 1), then 
extendEu (m,x) will give you a value for y in the second component.
